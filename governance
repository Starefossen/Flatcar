# overview


Flatcar is a community based project, anyone who wants to participate is welcomed. We adopted the (CNCF code of conduct) [https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md] as we pledge to be an opening and welcoming community for anyone who want to participate in it.


## Roles and responsibilities


### Contributer


Contributors are members of the Flatcar community who are engaged and wish to add to the project. Anyone can contribute to the project and become a contributor, regardless of their skillset. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements, and no selection process. There are many ways to contribute to the project, which may be one or more of the following (but not limited to):

- Reporting bugs and/or fixing them. 
- Posting feature requests
- Taking an ownership on maintineg spcific packages up to date. 
- Updating/writing documentation
- Submitting pull requests or patches
- Improving the Flatcar website.
- Joining discussions on Twitter, our community [Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C03GQ8B5XNJ) ,[Matrix channel](https://app.element.io/#/room/#flatcar:matrix.org) and office hours. 
- Evangelizing about the project. 

For first-time contributors, itâ€™s recommended to start by going through [Contributing-git](https://github.com/flatcar-linux/Flatcar/blob/main/contributions-git.md), and joining our community Slack channel or Matrix channel. 


### Committers

Committers are active community members who are responsible for the overall quality and stewardship of the project. Committers are part of the organization with write access to all repositories. Committers are expected to remain actively involved in the project and participate in voting and discussing of proposed project level changes.

Typically, a potential committer needs to show that they have a sufficient understanding of the project, its objectives, and its strategy. To become a committer, you are expected to:
- express an interest to the existing maintainers about becoming becoming a committer; and
- have created substantial PRs.


### Maintainers

Contribution per se does not qualify someone to become a maintainer. Maintainers are first and foremost contributors that have shown they are committed to the long term success of a project. Contributors wanting to become maintainers are expected to be deeply involved in contributing code, pull request review, and triage of issues.
Maintainership is about building trust with the current maintainers of the project and being a person that they can depend on to make decisions in the best interest of the project in a consistent manner.

Committers wanting to become maintainers are expected to:

- Collaborate well.
- Demonstrate a deep and comprehensive understanding of the Flatcar code base, technical goals, and directions.
- Actively engage with major Flatcar feature proposals and implementations.

Periodically, the existing maintainers curate a list of contributors that have shown regular activity on the project over the prior months. The nominating maintainer will create a PR to update the Maintainers List. It is recommended to describe the reasons for the nomination and the contribution of the nominee in the PR. Upon consensus of incumbent maintainers, the PR will be approved and the new maintainer becomes active.

Life priorities, interests, and passions can change. If you're a maintainer but feel you must remove yourself from the list, inform other maintainers that you intend to step down, and if possible, help find someone to pick up your work. 
At the very least, ensure your work can be continued where you left off.

After you've informed other maintainers, create a pull request to remove yourself from the MAINTAINERS file.
